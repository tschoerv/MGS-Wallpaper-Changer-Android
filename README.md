# Mutant Garden Seeder Wallpaper Changer Android

After installing the .apk, go to Settings -> Apps -> MGS Wallpaper Changer -> Remove permissions if app is unused: OFF !!
This is very important otherwise the system kills permissions before the next wallpaper update.
Open the app and adjust the settings to your preferences (update interval takes decimals too).
Click "Start Service" to start the wallpaper changing service.
Tapping onto "last wallpaper update" refreshes it.
To stop the service press the red button.
The service also automatically starts after every boot of the device, so you start it once and forget about it.

Have fun and enjoy your Mutant Garden Seeder!
