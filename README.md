# MGS-Wallpaper-Changer-Android

After installing the .apk, open the app and adjust the settings to your preferences.
Click "Start Service" to start the wallpaper changing service.
A notification appears in your status bar which is always present as long as the service is running. 
To stop the service press the red button.
The service also automatically starts after every boot of the device, so you start it once and forget about it.

Have fun and enjoy your Mutant Garden Seeder!
